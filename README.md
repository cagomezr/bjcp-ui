2015 BJCP Style Guidelines matrix UI

## Goal
[Official BJCP style guidelines](https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php) can be hard to navigate, sort or filter. I'm using [@gthmb](https://github.com/gthmb/)'s [bjcp-2015-json](https://github.com/gthmb/bjcp-2015-json/) repository to populate simple matrix of all beer styles with basic informations. 

### Functionalities

#### Displaying by
Matrix allows to modify tile color according to chosen option. More darker tone, bigger value. For example with selected "ABV" with red background, piwo grodziskie and scottish light will be almost pink and American barley wine and Eisbock will be maroon. Available options: color in SRM, bitterness in IBU, ABV in percentage.

#### Sorting by
Matrix allows to change order of tiles according to chosen option. Available options: BJCP index, style name, color in SRM, bitterness in IBU, ABV in percentage.

#### Filtering by tags
Matrix allows to filter tiles according to chosen tag. Tags are built from descriptions of all styles.
